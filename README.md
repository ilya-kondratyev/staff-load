# staff-load
A project for managing IT-consulting staff load 
## What and Why
During my work as a Head of Engineering Division i've realized that often it's desireable to have a tool to manage and monitor staff load in high level manner. It's usefull to plan projects, to plan staff leave, to solve resource conflicts, to produce diferent reports to executives of company and many other usages.
This project is the first try to make a solution that meets all my requirements.
## Objectives
* to have list of projects with assigned engineer currently in Implementation state
* to have a list of forecasted projects with assigned engineers
* to have a statistics of overall load of every engineer
